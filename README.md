AP Computer Science A Workspace
================================

This repository collects my daily practice, labs, and long-form projects for AP CSA.  It is meant as a personal study log and a communication channel with collaborators or instructors.

Ethics & Usage
--------------
- The code is provided purely for reference and collaboration.  Do not submit it as your own work.
- I am not responsible for any academic-integrity violations that stem from reusing this code base.

Repository Map
--------------
- `2508/` … `2512/`, `2601/`: dated folders that mirror the class calendar (e.g., `2509/0915` contains exercises from September 15).  Use these to track progress or revisit topic-specific practice.
- `Labs/`: official lab assignments such as `Bang_Xiao_Number_Slots_Lab` and `Bang_Xiao_TriviaLab` organized by lab title.
- `Projects/`: larger deliverables (First Quarter, Second Quarter, etc.) that aggregate multiple classes of work.
- `2512/read.md`: journal-style notes for December sessions.

Tools & Running Code
--------------------
1. Install a recent JDK (Java 17+ recommended).
2. Compile any standalone exercise with `javac Path/To/File.java` from the repo root.
3. Run compiled programs with `java ClassName` while staying in the same directory as the `.class` files.

Workflow Tips
-------------
- Each dated folder generally stands alone; compile within that directory to avoid classpath conflicts.
- Labs and projects may span multiple files.  Use an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code with Java extensions, etc.) to simplify running multi-class setups.
- Keep notes or TODOs inside the corresponding dated folder so future you can match lessons with code quickly.
